    by using ng-app, we bound our module/application with html.
    So from now, anything in this DOM tree, from the beginning 
    where we mentioned ng-app to the end of that tag, 
    which in this case is beginning html and end html, 
    our Angular application is responsible for. 
    So this model has now been bound, this AngularJS app has been bound to our HTML. -->
